    <h1>What is Peritus?</h1>
    <p>My name is Blake Calhoun.  Thank you for using this app.
      Being catholic is challenging without a deep knowledge of scripture,
      thorough understanding of
      the catechism, or knowing when and where your next confession is located.
      </p>
    <p>According to Wikipedia, "Peritus is the title given to Roman Catholic theologians
      attending an ecumenical council
      to give advice. At the Second Vatican Council, some periti accompanied
      individual bishops or groups of bishops from various countries.
      Others were formally appointed as advisers to the whole Council."
    </p>
    <p>I created this site to
      provide further resources for catholics who desire them.
      If you have any suggestions, concerns, critiques,
      or comments that can help make this website any better, please let me know.
      Thank you for visiting!
